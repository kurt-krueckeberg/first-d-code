y.d uses split() and it works. 

Questions: 
I know matchAll() can be used. It can probably be used with the "g" flag.

matchFirst() quits after the first hit, whereas matchAll() continues to find other subsequents instances where the match is true?

Using expression capture changes the effects of the regex--right?

It seems that spli() is the most straight forward choice--right?
